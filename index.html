          <h2>Who is Toji Fushiguro?</h2>
          <p>
            Toji Fushiguro is a significant character from the "Jujutsu Kaisen"
            anime and manga series. Known for his powerful physical abilities
            and unique cursed energy, Toji was once part of the Zenin family.
            His abilities and ruthless nature make him a fearsome warrior.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h2>Toji's Appearance</h2>

            Toji is a tall, muscular man with mid-length straight black hair
            that reaches to his ears. His eyes are green, just like his son's,
            and he has thin black eyebrows and a scar on the corner of his right
            lip.

          <h2>Toji's Legacy</h2>
          <p>
            Toji's impact on the Jujutsu world is profound. Although he was an
            outcast from his clan, his strength and combat prowess earned him
            the nickname "Sorcerer Killer." His son, Megumi Fushiguro, is a
            major character in the series and is deeply affected by his father's
            legacy.
